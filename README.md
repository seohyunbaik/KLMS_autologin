# KLMS_autologin
A auto login tool for KLMS/KAISTportal
Works on Safari brower for macOS
Before you run this, you must enable some safari features


You must modify the code of afari_initialization.applescript.
replacing the placeholder password to your actual KAIST account password.

I've attached the shortcut file to.


The file running order is:

1. safari_initialization.applescript
2. mail_work.applescript
3. safari_finish.applescript


don't think it is very legal.
don't think it is very safe.
don't know if it will work on your computer.
